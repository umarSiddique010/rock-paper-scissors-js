## Overview
The **Rock-Paper-Scissors Game** is a creative and engaging project designed to deepen my understanding of fundamental programming and design concepts. Inspired by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), this project reflects my originality and vision, featuring:
- An independently imagined game flow, design, and UI/UX.
- Implementation of **SOLID principles** and modular JavaScript.
- A fully responsive and interactive interface built with custom CSS.

## Features
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Users can choose between Rock, Paper, or Scissors, with live feedback on the results.
- **Dynamic Feedback**: Displays the winner of each round and updates the user interface accordingly.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience across devices.
- **Reset Functionality**: A reset button allows users to restart the game effortlessly.

## Color Palette
This project uses a cohesive and modern color scheme to enhance the user experience:
- **Primary Background**: `#222831` (Dark Charcoal)
- **Game Pad Background**: `#31363F` (Slate Gray)
- **Text Color**: `#EEEEEE` (Off-White)
- **Accent Color**: `#76ABAE` (Soft Cyan for buttons and highlights)
- **Shadow Color**: `#EEEEEE` (Light Gray for depth and emphasis)

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structured the page layout and semantic elements.
- **CSS**: Styled with a responsive and minimalist design for modern aesthetics.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Applied dynamic functionality, game logic, and event handling.
- **SOLID Principles**: Integrated principles for scalable and maintainable code.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Used classes and encapsulation to manage game logic efficiently.
