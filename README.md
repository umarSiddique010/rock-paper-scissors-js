## Overview

The **Rock-Paper-Scissors Game** is a creative and engaging project designed to deepen my understanding of fundamental programming and design concepts. Inspired by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), this project reflects my originality and vision, featuring:

- An independently imagined game flow, design, and UI/UX.
- Implementation of **SOLID principles** and modular JavaScript.
- A fully responsive and interactive interface built with custom CSS.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Users can choose between Rock, Paper, or Scissors, with live feedback on the results.
- **Dynamic Feedback**: Displays the winner of each round and updates the user interface accordingly.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience across devices.
- **Reset Functionality**: A reset button allows users to restart the game effortlessly.

## Color Palette

This project uses a cohesive and modern color scheme to enhance the user experience:

- **Primary Background**: `#222831` (Dark Charcoal)
